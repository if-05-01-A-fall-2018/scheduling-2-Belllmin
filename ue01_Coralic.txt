Assignment 8: Scheduling

1.) Multiple Queues A process on a system with Multiple Queues Scheduling needs 30 quanta to complete.
    How many times must it be swapped in, including the very first time (before it has run at all)?

    A: 5-Times because (Multiple Queues Example - Acc:31 -> Run: 5)

2.) Shortest Process Next A scheduler working with the {\em Shortest Process Next} Strategy has two processes 
    in ready state and has to schedule one of these:

    Table...
 
    Which process will be taken by the scheduler and why?

    A: See Page -> Algorithm to Estimate Time to Run for a Process...
       We have 4 numbers, so that means we need formula:

       4th estimate E = T/8 + T/8 + T/4 + T/2

       A - > 50/8 + 150/8 + 300/4 + 85/2 = 142.5
       B - > 300/8 + 150/8 + 85/4 + 50/2 = 102.5

       B will be taken by the scheduler because: (B < A)

3.) CPU-bound and I/O-bound Processes

	Explain in a few words the terms CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes.
	Why is it important for the scheduler to distinguish between CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes?


    A: CPU bound processes (no user interaction / no IO)
       - Need high quanta but low priority

       I/O-bound processes (high user interaction) need small quanta  
       - Need low quanta but high priority

4.) Real Time Schedulable A soft real-time system has four periodic events with periods of 50, 100, 200, and
    250 msec each. Suppose that the four events require 35, 20, 10 and $x$ msec of CPUtime, respectively.
    What is the largest value of $x$ for which the system is schedulable?

    A: on page -> Schedulable Real-Time Systems, so:

       - Assume m periodic events
       - An event i occurs within period Pi and requires Ci seconds of CPU time to be handled
       - If the following condition holds, the system is schedulable

       Char - Ci/Pi <= 1
    
       35/50  +  20/100  +  10/200  +  x/250  <=  1
       0.95 + x/250  <=  1
       x <= (1 - 0.95) * 250
       x <= 12.5

       The largest value of $x$ is 12.5
